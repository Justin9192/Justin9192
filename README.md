- 👋 Hi, I’m @Justin9192
- 👀 I’m interested in contributing to open-source projects however I can.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning **Full-Stack Web Development**.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project that requires assistance in proofreading documentation *until I can contribute code-wise.*
- 📫 How to reach me? On GitHub is best.
